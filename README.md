# Hypertag Widgets
###### A collection of widgets and examples written for the Hypertag.js framework.

##### What

* Escape Converter: Allows you to escape any raw text in a textarea into a JS string, or the reverse.
* DecimalDegrees: Converts LatLng d/m/s or d/m.m to decimal degrees and back again. 
* Hyperleaf: A Data-Driven Leaflet map template 

##### Why

* Tools for standalone websites
* .hyp component libs for reuse

##### Where

You may deploy these on your own sites freely and without restriction: [MIT licensed](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) unless otherwise noted.

##### When

I decided to start making very simple, reusable widgets anyone can share shortly after official [Hypertag.io](http://hypertag.io) launch in late Nov, 2014.

##### How

With either Textmate 2 or Ace, depending on wether I was using [TagOS](http://tagos.io) as my IDE or developing plain HTML on the desktop.
