# TagOS & Nametag.js Examples
###### A collection of widgets and examples written for the Nametag.js framework.

##### What

Some of these are for (TagOS)[http://desktop.tagos.io/], and some are HTML for deployment as standalone site widgets.  They are all easily portable between these contexts.

##### Why

* Examples for TagOS
* Tools for standalone websites
* Demonstration of [Nametag's simple syntax](http://tagos.io/docs.html)

##### Where

You may deploy these on your own site freely and without restriction, as long as you comply with the respective OSS licence.

##### When

I decided to start making very simple, reusable widgets anyone can share shortly after offical [Tagos.io](http://tagos.io) launch in late Nov, 2014.

##### How

With either Textmate 2 or Ace, depending on wether I was using TagOS as my IDE or developing plain HTML on the desktop.
