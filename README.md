# Hypertag Widgets
###### A collection of widgets and examples written for the Hypertag.js framework.

### What

__Escape Converter__
----
Allows you to escape any raw text in a textarea into a JS string, or the reverse.

__DecimalDegrees__
----
Converts LatLng d/m/s or d/m.m to decimal degrees and back again. 

__Hyperleaf__ 
----        
A Data-Driven Leaflet map template 

### Why

* Templates formatted for standalone websites
* __.hyp__ template libs for reuse
* To give you useful widgets to use in your own sites right away

### Where

You may reuse any of this code in your own sites freely and without restriction.
[MIT licensed](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) unless otherwise noted.

### How

Look in the ```<head>``` of .html files to see the ```<script>``` and  ```<link>``` dependencies.  Right now they all point to the Hypertag library CDN.  
    
Of course you can download these files and serve them from your own domain when you run a Hypertag application.

Hypertag.js is GPLv3, so keep that in mind in f licensing issues are a concern for you.

### When

I decided to start making very simple, reusable widgets anyone can share shortly after official [Hypertag.io](http://hypertag.io) launch in late Nov, 2014.
