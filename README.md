# TagOS & Nametag.js Examples
###### A collection of widgets and examples written for the Nametag.js framework.

##### What

Some of these are for [TagOS](http://desktop.tagos.io/), and some are HTML for deployment as standalone site widgets.  They are all easily portable between these contexts.

Examples in this repo

* Character Chart: intended to print a table of all possible HTML ASCII character entities programatically.  Instead it demonstrates a current bug :)
* Escape Converter: Allows you to escape any raw text in a textarea into a JS string, or the reverse.
* Folder Size:  Prints a list of top level TagOS directories and the space used by the files in them.
* Password Safe: An encrypted password/account manager. This is not a tiny example and may be moved into its own repo after it gets to a certain size.

##### Why

* Examples for TagOS
* Tools for standalone websites
* Demonstration of [Nametag's simple syntax](http://tagos.io/docs.html)

##### Where

You may deploy these on your own sites freely and without restriction, as long as you comply with the respective OSS licenses.

##### When

I decided to start making very simple, reusable widgets anyone can share shortly after official [Tagos.io](http://tagos.io) launch in late Nov, 2014.

##### How

With either Textmate 2 or Ace, depending on wether I was using TagOS as my IDE or developing plain HTML on the desktop.
